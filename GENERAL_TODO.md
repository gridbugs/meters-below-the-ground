# General Todo

Stuff I plan to do once the 7drl is over to improve libraries.

## Prototty

- Mouse support

## Entity Store Code Gen

- first-class component updates
- spatial hash key/value store for sets with types
- component type groups

```
enum ComponentType {
    ...
    Meter(MeterType),
    ...
}
```

## ???

- Handle different colour palletes better
